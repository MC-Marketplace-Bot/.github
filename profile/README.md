# Common Q&A questions

1. Q. What is this Bot?

- A - this is a bot specially designed to link to your Microsoft account, and in return, give you access to view, share and obtain statistics on your account and or catalog items supplied by the marketplace.

2. Q. Why am I forced to link to use these bots commands?

- A - without a link, there is no way for the bot to access your profile data from the marketplace. All of these commands are specifically designed to work off the user using the bot. However unlinked, users can view the marketplace catalog like the website.

3. Q. Can I purchase priced item for free?

- A - No you can not. This bot is designed to work just like the in game marketplace. Therfore there is no way to obtain paid items for free, however we do offer a `/market claimall` for anyone who wants to claim all the free items the marketplace has to offer. They will be claimed straight to your account.

4. Q. Can I look up other players Minecoins and Statistics?

- A - Unfortunately this is not allowed as this would go against Minecraft policy. Your account statistics and contents are for you and you only to acquire/request.

5. Q. Can I buy Minecoins with the bot?

- A - Unfortunately we are unable to make the bot buy minecoins as they are obtained with Microsoft Xbox Currency. However we do offer a method for redeeming Xbox codes with `/market 
redeem`, but you would have to buy the minecoins manually.

6. Q. I want to remove my Linked account data from this bot. Can I?

- A - you are allowed to /unlink at any time you like. This will remove any instance of your account from the bot. You can feel free to re-link your account again at any time.
